1) Configure menuconfig.py like you want.
   The search paths for the file name are
   /usr/share/pixmaps and /usr/share/icons.

2) Write your ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml and insert the comments:
    <!-- BEGIN AUTOMENU -->
    <!-- END AUTOMENU -->
   Each comment has to be on a single line.

3) Execute menu.py
   The menu is written between the comments in menu.xml.
