1) Configure menuconfig.py like you want.
   The first list item is the menu title, the second
   one are the categories in the *.desktop files.
   A plus sign means inclusion, a minus sign is exclusion.
   The third item specifies the icon name, either a full path
   or a file name. The search path for the file name is
   /usr/share/pixmaps and /usr/share/icons.

2) Write your ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml and insert the comments:
    <!-- BEGIN AUTOMENU -->
    <!-- END AUTOMENU -->
   Each comment has to be on a single line.

3) Execute menu.py, run
    $ openbox --reconfigure.
   The menu is written between the comments in menu.xml.
